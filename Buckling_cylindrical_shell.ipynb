    "# Buckling of a cylindrical shell\n",
    "\n",
    "In the present notebook, the critical load of a uniformly compressed cylindrical shell is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "A cylindrical shell is considered ($L$: length; $R$: radius; $h$: thickness).\n",
    "\n",
    "The constitutive material follows a Kirchhoff--Saint-Venant law ($E$: Young modulus, $\\nu$: Poisson ratio).\n",
    "\n",
    "The shell is subjected to an axial compression $q$, so that the total applied force is $2\\pi Rq$. For each value of the applied load $q$, we find a particular equilibrium $\\mathbf u^\\star(q)$, the so-called *fundamental path*. In the present case, the fundamental path is axisymmetric, constant in $z$. Note that $\\mathbf u^\\star(q)$ is in fact a field, that depends on the observation point $\\mathsf M$: $\\mathbf u^\\star(\\mathsf M, q)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We seek the *critical* value of $q$, $q_\\mathrm{cr}$, for which the equilibrium on the fondamental path, $\\mathbf u^\\star(q_\\text{cr})$ becomes unstable. The approach that we follow here is quite general: we first compute the total potential energy $\\Pi(\\mathbf u, q)$ of the system, *including geometric non-linearities*. For a fixed value of the loading parameter $q$, we then evaluate the total potential energy *in the neighborhood* of the fundamental path, and check whether the potentatial energy is indeed minimal. In other words, we must assess the sign of the following quantity\n",

    "\\Pi[\\mathbf u^\\star(q)+\\delta\\mathbf u, q]-\\Pi[\\mathbf u^\\star(q), q].\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "For a *fully rigorous stability analysis*, the above quantity should be evaluated for *any* test-function $\\delta\\mathbf u$. As a first step, we will evaluate the potential energy for a two-parameter family of test-functions. This therefore provides an estimate *in excess* of the critical load.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the present derivation is somewhat tedious; we will therefore call the [sympy](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/index.html) library to the rescue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is organized as follows. In Sec. 1, we define the geometry of the underformed cylinder."
